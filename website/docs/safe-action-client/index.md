# Safe action client

The safe action client instance is created by the `createSafeActionClient()` function. The instance is used to create safe actions, as you have already seen in previous sections of the documentation. You can create multiple clients too, for different purposes, as explained [in this section](/docs/recipes/extending-base-client).

You can also provide functions to the client, to customize the behavior for every action you then create with it. We will explore them in detail in the next sections.
