# i18n

If you're using a i18n solution, there's a high probability that you'll need to await the translations and then pass them to schemas.\
next-safe-action allows you to do that by passing an async function to the [`schema`](/docs/safe-action-client/instance-methods#schema) method that returns a promise with the schema.\
The setup is pretty simple:

```typescript
"use server";

import { actionClient } from "@/lib/safe-action";
import { z } from "zod";
import { getTranslations } from "my-i18n-lib";

async function getSchema() {
  // This is an example of a i18n setup.
  const t = await getTranslations();
  return mySchema(t); // this is the schema that will be used to validate and parse the input
}

export const myAction = actionClient.schema(getSchema).action(async ({ parsedInput }) => {
  // Do something useful here...
});
```
