# React Hook Form

next-safe-action works great in combo with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

By using the react-hook-form adapter, you'll get first-class integration and complete customization for advanced use cases. First, install the following dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i next-safe-action react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers @next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form
```

Then, take a look at the project page on GitHub to learn how to use it: [@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form](https://github.com/next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form).
