## Project Overview

next-safe-action is a TypeScript library for type-safe, validated Next.js Server Actions. It provides a chainable client API with middleware, input/output validation (via Standard Schema v1, Zod, Yup, etc.), and React hooks for client-side consumption.

## Monorepo Structure

- **`packages/next-safe-action`**: the core library (source in `src/`, tests in `src/__tests__/`)
- **`packages/adapter-react-hook-form`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form` adapter for seamless react-hook-form integration
- **`packages/adapter-tanstack-query`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-tanstack-query` adapter for TanStack Query mutation integration
- **`packages/adapter-routes`**: JSON mutation route handlers and optional OpenAPI 3.1 generation for selected actions
- **`packages/adapter-better-auth`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-better-auth` adapter for Better Auth session middleware integration
- **`apps/playground`**: Next.js app for manual testing (Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Shiki code viewer)
- **`apps/docs`**: Fumadocs documentation site (content in `content/docs/`, MDX)

## Code Style

- **Formatter**: Oxfmt, tabs (tabWidth 2), printWidth 120, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas (es5), import sorting, Tailwind CSS class sorting. Config in `.oxfmtrc.json`.
- **Linter**: Oxlint with type-aware checking via `oxlint-tsgolint`. Shared base config in `.oxlintrc.base.json`, package overrides in per-package `.oxlintrc.json`. Plugins: oxc, eslint, unicorn, typescript, react, react-perf (library packages), plus nextjs (app packages).
- **TypeScript**: strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Library lint runs `tsc --noEmit && oxlint --type-aware .`.
- Prefer explicit type imports/exports (enforced by Oxlint).
- **CSS**: Tailwind v4 with CSS-first configuration (no tailwind.config file), PostCSS via `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- **Punctuation**: Never use em dashes. Use commas, colons, or other appropriate punctuation instead.

## Architecture

The library has three entry points: `next-safe-action` (server), `next-safe-action/hooks`, and `next-safe-action/stateful-hooks` (client). The RHF adapter has two: `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form` and `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form/hooks`. The TanStack Query adapter has one: `@next-safe-action/adapter-tanstack-query`. The Better Auth adapter has one: `@next-safe-action/adapter-better-auth`. The routes adapter has two: `@next-safe-action/adapter-routes` and its optional `/openapi` entry.

**Server-side core:**
- `safe-action-client.ts`: `SafeActionClient` class with chainable methods: `use()` (middleware), `metadata()`, `inputSchema()`, `outputSchema()`, `bindArgsSchema()`, `action()`, `stateAction()`
- `action-builder.ts`: core execution engine: runs the middleware stack, validates input/output via Standard Schema, handles errors
- `deep-merge.ts`: dependency-free `deepmerge()` used to merge middleware context objects (inlined from `deepmerge-ts` to keep the package free of runtime dependencies)
- `middleware.ts`: `createMiddleware()` for standalone middleware definitions. Its optional synchronous `onActionDefined` callback receives a frozen, read-only action description at definition time. Direct input schemas are retained separately from factories; callbacks never execute factories.
- `inspectFrameworkError()`: narrow public inspector reusing the existing framework parsers for redirects, HTTP access statuses, and other control-flow signals.
- `validation-errors.ts`: error formatting and flattening utilities
- `server-error.ts`: `returnServerError()` for typed, expected server errors that bypass `handleServerError` (digest-encoded to survive `"use cache"` boundaries)
- `utils.ts`: utility constants (`DEFAULT_SERVER_ERROR_MESSAGE`) and helpers
- `standard-schema.ts`: Standard Schema v1 interface definitions and type utilities for schema inference
- `next/errors/`: `FrameworkErrorHandler` class with handlers for redirect, router, bailout-to-CSR, dynamic-usage, postpone, and HTTP access fallback (404/403/401) errors

**Client-side hooks:**
- `hooks.ts`: all four client hooks: `useAction`, `useOptimisticAction`, `useStateAction`, and `useOptimisticStateAction`
- `hooks-shared.ts`: base hook logic (`useActionBase`) shared by `useAction` and `useOptimisticAction`, including the `onTransitionStart` seam that lets the optimistic hook dispatch inside the action's transition. The `startTransition` callback deliberately does not return the promise chain (React would otherwise own it: `isTransitioning` for the whole request, optimistic value pinned to it, rejected requests thrown into the error boundary), and it never re-throws inside `.catch`, since that only produces an unhandled rejection nobody can catch. Errors reach the caller through hook state, the callbacks, and the `executeAsync` rejection.
- `hooks-utils.ts`: shared hook utilities (`getActionStatus`, `getActionShorthandStatusObject`, `useActionCallbacks`)
- `stateful-hooks.ts`: backward-compat re-export of `useStateAction`; the implementation lives in `hooks.ts`
- `useStateActionInternal` (private, in `hooks.ts`): shared implementation behind `useStateAction` and `useOptimisticStateAction`, wrapping React's `useActionState`. Owns the stateful path's concurrency invariants (FIFO resolver queue, reset generations, ambient-transition double-apply, pending-flag masking, dropping post-`reset` queued dispatches before they reach the server) and exposes them through optional `strategies` seams (`onTransitionStart`, `resolvePrevResult`, `onDispatchSettled`, `onReset`, `suppressCallbacks`). Extend via those seams rather than by copying the hook. `onReset` receives the authoritative reset generation: a consumer must never derive its own from rendered state, because two `reset()` calls batched into one event advance the internal counter twice. A raw throw drains and rejects every queued resolver before rethrowing, since React clears its whole action queue when an Action rejects; a throw from a dispatch that a `reset` already made stale returns `{}` instead of rethrowing, so it cannot cancel fresh queued work. A dispatch that a `reset` marked stale *before* it took its turn in the queue never calls the action at all: nothing was sent yet, so the write is skipped (its `executeAsync` promise resolves with `{}`). Only the dispatch already awaiting the server survives a `reset`, because that one cannot be recalled.
- `useOptimisticStateAction` keeps confirmed **domain** state separate from the `SafeActionResult` envelope: the envelope is a discriminated union, so `result.data` is `undefined` on every error branch. Two distinct "last confirmed" values are tracked on purpose, one derived from the committed result (what the user sees, advances only when the queue drains, so payloads can't double-apply) and one advanced at dispatch time (what the server gets as `prevResult`). `ActionDataFitsState` constrains the call site so `Data` must be assignable to `State` unless the action returns nothing, which makes the internal `data -> State` cast sound. Refs are never written during render (an abandoned concurrent render would leak uncommitted state into the next dispatch); the confirmed value is derived purely and the writes happen in a layout effect. An optimistic payload folds only while its dispatch is still pending, which is React's own `useOptimistic` rule: the hook keeps payloads alive across the whole queue because the visible base normally does not advance until the queue drains, so a `currentState` that commits mid-queue would leave the settled payloads folding on top of a base that already carries them. Each payload therefore records its dispatch id, and a mid-queue prop raises a cut to whatever had settled when it arrived. The whole payload model rests on one React behavior that this hook cannot enforce: React withholds the `useActionState` commit until the queue drains, so the base cannot move under the attached payloads except through an urgent update. That assumption is pinned by the `React withholds the committed result until the whole queue drains` canary test; if it ever fails, the settled payloads double-apply through `result` instead of through a prop. Precedence between `currentState` and an action's `data` is answered twice: by arrival for the rendered value, and by write order for `lastServerDataRef`, the base the next queued dispatch sends to the server. Arrival order alone is wrong for the server base, because a payload that commits while an action runs was rendered before that action wrote; ordering settles it with no bookkeeping, since `onDispatchSettled` runs after the layout effect exactly when the payload predates the write, and before it otherwise.

**Type system:**
- `index.types.ts`: core types with full generic inference for schemas, middleware context, and action results
- `hooks.types.ts`, `utils.types.ts`, `validation-errors.types.ts`: supporting type definitions

**Build & distribution:**
- ESM-only output (`.mjs` + `.d.mts`) via tsdown
- pnpm catalogs in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` centralize shared dependency versions
- Turborepo orchestrates build/test/lint tasks with dependency-aware caching

## Routes adapter

The adapter exposes actions only when routes middleware, endpoint metadata, and explicit registration are all present. Versioned non-enumerable descriptors use `Symbol.for`, not a global registry. Route tables compile once and reject ambiguous templates. HTTP input uses bounded JSON reads and explicit origin checks (Origin against `X-Forwarded-Proto`/URL scheme plus `X-Forwarded-Host`/`Host`, since Next.js builds `request.url` from the configured hostname); application middleware owns authentication and authorization, and `stateSchema` validation plus `mapInput` run before the action's middleware stack. Sanitized 500 responses report their cause through the optional `onError` callback. The optional OpenAPI entry converts Standard JSON Schema resources without executing actions; each component is its own resource with a generated `$id`, so overrides must not use document-relative `#/components/` references. `requestBodyRequired` defaults to "an input schema exists", and `parameters` overrides are typed and checked against the path template. Production route and hook canaries live in `apps/playground/e2e/routes.spec.ts` and run in `pnpm run test:pg`.

## Testing

- Framework: Vitest
- Runtime test files follow `feature-name.test.ts` naming convention (`.test.tsx` for hook tests)
- Type tests in `src/__tests__/types/` follow `feature-name.test-d.ts` naming convention (Vitest `typecheck` mode)
- Add regression tests for behavioral or API changes

## Dependency Policy

**Never add entries to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This key must stay absent from the file.**

pnpm 11 applies a default `minimumReleaseAge` of 1440 minutes (24 hours), so a freshly published version cannot be installed until it has been on the registry for a full day. This is the repository's main defense against a compromised release: most malicious npm publishes are detected and unpublished within hours. `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` opts specific versions out of that cooldown and defeats the protection, which is why it is banned here, with no exceptions and no "just this once" entries.

Rules when updating dependencies:

- If a version range cannot resolve because every matching version is younger than 24 hours, **lower the range** to the newest version that is at least 24 hours old (for example `^13.1.0` becomes `^13.0.0`). Do not add an exclude entry, and do not disable or lower `minimumReleaseAge`.
- Prefer a slightly older, proven version over the newest release. Being one patch behind for a day is the intended trade-off.
- Never pass `--ignore-scripts=false`, and never widen `allowBuilds` without an explicit request. Packages outside `allowBuilds` must not run install scripts.
- Keep every dependency resolved from the npm registry. Do not introduce git or direct tarball resolutions, `overrides`, or `patchedDependencies` as a workaround for a blocked version.
- After a dependency update, run `pnpm audit` and confirm the update does not introduce new advisories.

## Changesets

PRs targeting `main` that touch package files should include a changeset. CI checks for this via `changeset status --since=origin/main`.

## Keeping This File Up to Date
