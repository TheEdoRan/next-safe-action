## Project Overview

next-safe-action is a TypeScript library for type-safe, validated Next.js Server Actions. It provides a chainable client API with middleware, input/output validation (via Standard Schema v1, Zod, Yup, etc.), and React hooks for client-side consumption.

## Monorepo Structure

- **`packages/next-safe-action`**: the core library (source in `src/`, tests in `src/__tests__/`)
- **`packages/adapter-react-hook-form`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form` adapter for seamless react-hook-form integration
- **`packages/adapter-tanstack-query`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-tanstack-query` adapter for TanStack Query mutation integration
- **`packages/adapter-better-auth`**: `@next-safe-action/adapter-better-auth` adapter for Better Auth session middleware integration
- **`apps/playground`**: Next.js app for manual testing (Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Shiki code viewer)
- **`apps/docs`**: Fumadocs documentation site (content in `content/docs/`, MDX)

## Code Style

- **Formatter**: Oxfmt, tabs (tabWidth 2), printWidth 120, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas (es5), import sorting, Tailwind CSS class sorting. Config in `.oxfmtrc.json`.
- **Linter**: Oxlint with type-aware checking via `oxlint-tsgolint`. Shared base config in `.oxlintrc.base.json`, package overrides in per-package `.oxlintrc.json`. Plugins: oxc, eslint, unicorn, typescript, react, react-perf (library packages), plus nextjs (app packages).
- **TypeScript**: strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Library lint runs `tsc --noEmit && oxlint --type-aware .`.
- Prefer explicit type imports/exports (enforced by Oxlint).
- **CSS**: Tailwind v4 with CSS-first configuration (no tailwind.config file), PostCSS via `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- **Punctuation**: Never use em dashes. Use commas, colons, or other appropriate punctuation instead.

## Architecture

The library has three entry points: `next-safe-action` (server), `next-safe-action/hooks`, and `next-safe-action/stateful-hooks` (client). The RHF adapter has two: `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form` and `@next-safe-action/adapter-react-hook-form/hooks`. The TanStack Query adapter has one: `@next-safe-action/adapter-tanstack-query`. The Better Auth adapter has one: `@next-safe-action/adapter-better-auth`.

**Server-side core:**
- `safe-action-client.ts`: `SafeActionClient` class with chainable methods: `use()` (middleware), `metadata()`, `inputSchema()`, `outputSchema()`, `bindArgsSchema()`, `action()`, `stateAction()`
- `action-builder.ts`: core execution engine: runs the middleware stack, validates input/output via Standard Schema, handles errors
- `deep-merge.ts`: dependency-free `deepmerge()` used to merge middleware context objects (inlined from `deepmerge-ts` to keep the package free of runtime dependencies)
- `middleware.ts`: `createMiddleware()` for standalone middleware definitions
- `validation-errors.ts`: error formatting and flattening utilities
- `server-error.ts`: `returnServerError()` for typed, expected server errors that bypass `handleServerError` (digest-encoded to survive `"use cache"` boundaries)
- `utils.ts`: utility constants (`DEFAULT_SERVER_ERROR_MESSAGE`) and helpers
- `standard-schema.ts`: Standard Schema v1 interface definitions and type utilities for schema inference
- `next/errors/`: `FrameworkErrorHandler` class with handlers for redirect, router, bailout-to-CSR, dynamic-usage, postpone, and HTTP access fallback (404/403/401) errors

**Client-side hooks:**
- `hooks.ts`: all four client hooks: `useAction`, `useOptimisticAction`, `useStateAction`, and `useOptimisticStateAction`
- `hooks-shared.ts`: base hook logic (`useActionBase`) shared by `useAction` and `useOptimisticAction`, including the `onTransitionStart` seam that lets the optimistic hook dispatch inside the action's transition
- `hooks-utils.ts`: shared hook utilities (`getActionStatus`, `getActionShorthandStatusObject`, `useActionCallbacks`)
- `stateful-hooks.ts`: backward-compat re-export of `useStateAction`; the implementation lives in `hooks.ts`
- `useStateActionInternal` (private, in `hooks.ts`): shared implementation behind `useStateAction` and `useOptimisticStateAction`, wrapping React's `useActionState`. Owns the stateful path's concurrency invariants (FIFO resolver queue, reset generations, ambient-transition double-apply, pending-flag masking) and exposes them through optional `strategies` seams (`onTransitionStart`, `resolvePrevResult`, `onDispatchSettled`, `onReset`, `suppressCallbacks`). Extend via those seams rather than by copying the hook.
- `useOptimisticStateAction` keeps confirmed **domain** state separate from the `SafeActionResult` envelope: the envelope is a discriminated union, so `result.data` is `undefined` on every error branch. Two distinct "last confirmed" values are tracked on purpose, one derived from the committed result (what the user sees, advances only when the queue drains, so payloads can't double-apply) and one advanced at dispatch time (what the server gets as `prevResult`).

**Type system:**
- `index.types.ts`: core types with full generic inference for schemas, middleware context, and action results
- `hooks.types.ts`, `utils.types.ts`, `validation-errors.types.ts`: supporting type definitions

**Build & distribution:**
- ESM-only output (`.mjs` + `.d.mts`) via tsdown
- pnpm catalogs in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` centralize shared dependency versions
- Turborepo orchestrates build/test/lint tasks with dependency-aware caching

## Testing

- Framework: Vitest
- Runtime test files follow `feature-name.test.ts` naming convention (`.test.tsx` for hook tests)
- Type tests in `src/__tests__/types/` follow `feature-name.test-d.ts` naming convention (Vitest `typecheck` mode)
- Add regression tests for behavioral or API changes

## Dependency Policy

**Never add entries to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This key must stay absent from the file.**

pnpm 11 applies a default `minimumReleaseAge` of 1440 minutes (24 hours), so a freshly published version cannot be installed until it has been on the registry for a full day. This is the repository's main defense against a compromised release: most malicious npm publishes are detected and unpublished within hours. `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` opts specific versions out of that cooldown and defeats the protection, which is why it is banned here, with no exceptions and no "just this once" entries.

Rules when updating dependencies:

- If a version range cannot resolve because every matching version is younger than 24 hours, **lower the range** to the newest version that is at least 24 hours old (for example `^13.1.0` becomes `^13.0.0`). Do not add an exclude entry, and do not disable or lower `minimumReleaseAge`.
- Prefer a slightly older, proven version over the newest release. Being one patch behind for a day is the intended trade-off.
- Never pass `--ignore-scripts=false`, and never widen `allowBuilds` without an explicit request. Packages outside `allowBuilds` must not run install scripts.
- Keep every dependency resolved from the npm registry. Do not introduce git or direct tarball resolutions, `overrides`, or `patchedDependencies` as a workaround for a blocked version.
- After a dependency update, run `pnpm audit` and confirm the update does not introduce new advisories.

## Changesets

PRs targeting `main` that touch package files should include a changeset. CI checks for this via `changeset status --since=origin/main`.

## Keeping This File Up to Date

When making changes to the codebase that affect information documented in this file, update the relevant sections of this file as part of the same change. Examples of changes that require an update:

- Adding, removing, or renaming packages or apps in the monorepo
- Bumping dependency versions in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalogs or root `package.json`
- Adding or removing source files, entry points, or exports in any package
- Changing build, test, lint, or format commands or tooling
- Modifying code style rules, linter config, or formatter config
- Altering the architecture (new hooks, middleware patterns, error handlers, etc.)

Do not wait for a separate follow-up: include the update in the same commit as the code change.
