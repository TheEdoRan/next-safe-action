> next-safe-action is a library that takes full advantage of the latest and greatest Next.js, React and TypeScript features, using validation libraries of your choice, to let you define typesafe Server Actions and execute them inside Client Components.

## Documentation

**Explore the documentation for version 6 of the library on [next-safe-action website](https://next-safe-action.dev).** ✨

## Next.js >= 14 vs 13

Server Actions are now a stable feature in React. For this reason, there were some internal breaking changes to the API, and so a new version of the library is required to prevent backward compatibility issues.

**You can continue to use `next-safe-action` version 4 for your Next.js 13 app.**

```bash
npm i next-safe-action # for Next.js >= 14
```

```bash
npm i next-safe-action@v4 # for Next.js 13
```
