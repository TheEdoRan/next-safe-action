**next-safe-action** is a library that takes full advantage of the latest and greatest Next.js, React and TypeScript features, using validation libraries of your choice, to let you define **type safe** Server Actions and execute them inside React Components.

## Documentation

**Explore the documentation for the current library version on [next-safe-action website](https://next-safe-action.dev).** âœ¨

## Next.js >= 14 vs 13

Server Actions are now a stable feature in React. For this reason, there were some internal breaking changes to the API, and so a new version of the library is required to prevent backward compatibility issues.

**You can continue to use `next-safe-action` version 4 for your Next.js 13 app.**

```bash
npm i next-safe-action # for Next.js >= 14
```

```bash
npm i next-safe-action@v4 # for Next.js 13
```

## Migration guide

Version 7.x.x of the library supports form actions and improves validation errors handling. Please check out the [v6 to v7 migration guide](https://next-safe-action.dev/docs/migrations/v6-to-v7) on the website for more information.
